**This is my ~/.vim.**  There are many like it, but this one is mine.

**My ~/.vim** is my best friend.  It is my life.  I must master it as I must master
my life.

**My ~/.vim**, without me, is actually quite useful, and I recommend you clone it.
Without my ~/.vim, I am useless.  I must format my code true.  I must code
quicker than my enemy who is trying to out-code me.  I must release early and
often before he releases.  I will..

**My ~/.vim** and I know that what counts in this war is not the line count, the
choice of framework, or the programming language.  We know that it is the user
experience that counts.  We will make user-friendly software...

**My ~/.vim** is human, even as I, because it is my life.  Thus, I will learn it as
a brother.  I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its
accessories, its :let and its :autocmd.  I will keep my ~/.vim clean and ready,
even as I am clean and ready.  We will become part of each other.  We will...

**Before His Noodliness, I swear this creed.  My ~/.vim** and I are the defenders of
my systems.  We are the masters of script kiddies.  We are the saviors of our
clients' data.

**So be it, until victory is Humanity's and there is no enemy, but peace!**
